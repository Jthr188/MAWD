        Greetings! My name is Jynyl Yvryl Kryzyl V. Manalansan. I was born in the year 2005 and currently at the age of 16. 
        I don't have a particular hobby but I enjoy playing games, drawing, and writing. I like cats a lot and I would love
        to keep a lot of them once I get old. I also like music and I make long playlists on my spotify account. I chose MAWD
        because I have always been fascinated by computers and I wish to be a web developer in the future.

        <i>“Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; 
        forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be 
        encumbered with your old nonsense.”</i>
